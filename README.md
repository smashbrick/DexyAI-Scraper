# Job Scraper

A full-stack application for scraping job listings based on user input. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is a Python Flask application. The project retrieves job data from a specified source and displays it on the frontend.

flask run

## üìù Things I Learned

### Bypassing 403 Forbidden Request
- To bypass the "403 Forbidden" error, I used a proxy service.
- The proxy I used is free, but it comes with some limitations:
  - The first request is delayed due to a cache updating mechanism.
  - Cache updates occur every hour, which means you need to wait for the cache to refresh after initial usage.

### Fetching Locations and Job Names
- Initially, I tried fetching queries for both locations and job names. However, this approach triggered a CAPTCHA challenge.
- To avoid CAPTCHA issues, I updated the job name value dynamically. For example:
  - A job title like "Software Engineer" is converted to a slug format, i.e., `software-engineer`, before sending the request.

## üêõ Known Issues
- **Slow Initial Request**: Due to proxy cache updates, the first request might take longer to process.
